					<p>The Southern Sqweeze recipe is simple as can be: create beautiful juices that feed the spirit. We believe that nourishing the body is the first step in nourishing a community, and as born and bred Chattanoogans, we can't think of a better way to show our neighbors just what they mean to us.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>In the South, food is love, love is food-and both are dead serious. We started Southern Sqweeze because it was exactly the kind of idea we were looking for: welcoming, homegrown, and healthful. Starting with cold-pressed, all-natural juices, we quickly expanded to light lunches and snacks, all crafted with the same focus on bringing originality and nourishment to our customers and friends.</p>
